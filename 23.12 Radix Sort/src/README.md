## Analysis Steps

 broke it down into two functions, the main and the sorting function. 
needed one list to receive random integers
sorting function to reorganize that list with a series of loops.
then it is outputed back in the main function

### Design

the main function is where the Array is first loaded in random order, and both sorted and un sorted 
arrays are outputted
the rdxsort function does the sorting work.
one for loop to initialize the bucket ArrayList.
then moves to while loop with multiple nested for loops
first one begins loading the bucket 
and the second one clears the array 
and outputs

 

```
Give examples
```

### Testing

check if it prints the random one
then check if it sorted the other one

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
