## Analysis Steps

First I set up the SortArrayList class so I could take advantage of the generics
then I went to the main to begin setting up the test class

### Design

First was a skeleton of the SortArrayList Class with its one method. I 
left them with minimal code to start. I then worked on the main where I loaded the 
ArrayList with Integers from the randomFill() method. once I got that up I went back to the 
SortArrayList class and began making loops to find the smallest number, place it, then move to the next number

Give examples

### Testing

A step by step series of examples that you developed to properly test the program. 

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
