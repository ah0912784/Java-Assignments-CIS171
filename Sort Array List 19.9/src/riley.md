### Grading Notes

#### Doc
- readme markdown file included - improperly named (no deduction at this point, but I want you to figure out what the problem has been!)
- readme displays image of program output
- code is commented - 

#### Project Development

- sort method properly declared
- sort method properly implemented
- sort method properly called

- good use of generics!
