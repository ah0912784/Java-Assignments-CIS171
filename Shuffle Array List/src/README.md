## Analysis Steps

Well it was pretty straight forward. I just had to load an array with integers 
and create a method to to randomize it's pattern.

### Design

One for loop to load the array then another to Shuffle it within a 
specified method to do so. with a random index used to shuffle the Array. 

```
Give examples
```

### Testing

First the for loop was constructed to load the Array.so once that tested positive I went on to the second
the second loop was more difficult but after I got past the errors it worked out fine

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
